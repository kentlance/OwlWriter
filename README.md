# ðŸ¦‰ OwlWriter

**Check it out here:** 

I wanted a writing app that looked specifically how I wanted it to. This has a very customizable interface so you can change it to however you like.

Inspired by <a href="https://blank.page/"  >blank.page</a>, and <a href="https://www.gibney.org/writer"  >Writer</a>.

## Features

- **Markdown**: Markdown support, with preview and shortcuts
- **Word & Character Counts**
- **Customizable Interface**
- **Export Options**: Export content as plain text (`.txt`), HTML (`.html`), or Markdown (`.md`).
- **Persistent Settings**: Your work is saved locally in your browser. **Make  sure to save often!**

# OwlWriter

I built this because I wanted a writer web app specifically with how I wanted it to look. This has a customizable interface to allow you to make the app look like however you want.

Inspired by <a href="https://blank.page/"  >blank.page</a>, and <a href="https://www.gibney.org/writer"  >Writer</a>.

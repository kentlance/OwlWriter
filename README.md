**Check it out here:** [owlwriter.pages.dev](https://owlwriter.pages.dev)

I wanted a writing app that looked specifically how I wanted it to. OwlWriter has a lot of tweaks including fonts, layouts, colors, with theme import and exports.

Inspired by <a href="https://blank.page/">blank.page</a> and <a href="https://www.gibney.org/writer">Writer</a>.

## Features

- **Markdown:** features markdown support, with preview and shortcuts  
- **Word & Character Counts**  
- **Customizable Interface:** supports theme import/export, font, layout, and color tweaks  
- **Export Options:** export content as plain text (`.txt`), HTML (`.html`), or Markdown (`.md`)  
- **Persistent Settings:** your work is saved locally in your browser, even when you exit the app. **Make sure to save often!**  
- **Offline Support:** OwlWriter works even without internet connection!
